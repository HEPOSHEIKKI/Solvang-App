# Solvang Android

Solvang is a material app for Android that insults you once a day in Estonian.


## ⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️

This app pulls the insults from my API, which is a dump of a public website on the Estonian ministry of language servers. The website has been open for user submissions from around the 90's, so it's not exactly what you'd call politically correct nowadays. Use at your own discretion, mkay?

Solvang supports material you:

## Installation

The app can be downloaded from the releases section, and f-droid support will be coming soon (via a 3rd party repo, I don't want this software tarnishing the official repos)

## License

This project is licensed under the [GPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) license. Stealing this code is highly discouraged, as it is written by my, and my java skills are non-existent. The codebase? What's that? Want the source code? It's all neatly packaged in a single, 400 line file.
